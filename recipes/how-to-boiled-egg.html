    <h2>How long to boil an egg</h2>
    <p>Follow these timings for how to boil an egg for a runny yolk, soft set centre or until hard boiled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 minutes: set white and runny yolk – just right for dipping into</li>
        <li>6 minutes: liquid yolk – a little less oozy</li>
        <li>7 minutes: almost set – deliciously sticky</li>
        <li>8 minutes: softly set – this is what you want to make Scotch eggs</li>
        <li>10 minutes: the classic hard-boiled egg – mashable but not dry and chalky</li>
